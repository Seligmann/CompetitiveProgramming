# CompetitiveProgramming
Competitive programming solutions from atcoder, codeforces, kattis, hackerrank, etc (even some leetcode).

As far as I know, the problem title format is as follows for the different platforms:  

* codeforces - ```<number><letter>```
* atcoder - ```<letters><number>_<letter>```
* leetcode - ```<name_of_problem>```
* kattis - ```<name_of_problem>```
